# Problem_Solving

## Surface Area

Design a function that takes in a 2-D array where each entry is the number of unit blocks (1 X 1) that are stacked on top of each other at each location and returns the surface area of the resultant 3-D object.

## How Sum

Design a function that takes in a `target sum` and a vector of positive integers, and returns a vector that sums to the target sum using only elements present in the provided vector of positive integers. Returns `-1` if `target sum` is unattainable.

## Best Sum

Identical to 'How Sum', except returns the vector with the least number of elements.

## Find Word

Design a function that takes in a `target word` and a vector of strings, and returns true if the strings in the vector can be arranged in any way to spell the `target word`, else it returns false.
