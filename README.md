# Problem Solving

## Dijkstra

Implementation of the famous Dijkstra's algorithm with early stopping and path-tracing. 

## Navigate Dungeon (mod)

Exactly the same as the previous function, except returns the actual shortest path travelled, and not the number of moves.

## Navigate Dungeon

Design a function that takes in a map of a dungeon (see code) and returns the number of moves required to escape the dungeon if possible, else return -1. The problem is solved using a breadth-first search. 

## Minimum Island

Design a function that takes in a 2-D array of L's and W's, and return the size of the smallest island.

## Count Islands (Python)

Design a function that takes in a 2-D array of L's and W's (L = land & W = water), and return the number of islands.

## Shortest Path

Design a function that takes in an adjacency list of a graph, a start node, and an end node, and return the least number of edges between the start node and the end node.

## Largest Island

Design a function that takes in an adjacency list of a graph and return the number of nodes that comprise the largest island.

## Count Islands (C++)

Design a function that takes in an adjacency list of a graph and returns the number of "islands" of the graph.

## Undirected Path

Design a function that takes in an edge list of an undirected graph, a start node, and a finish node, and returns true if it is possible to travel from the starting node to the finish node, else it returns false.

## Find Word

Design a function that takes in a `target word` and a vector of strings, and returns true if the strings in the vector can be arranged in any way to spell the `target word`, else it returns false.

## Best Sum

Identical to 'How Sum', except returns the vector with the least number of elements.

## How Sum

Design a function that takes in a `target sum` and a vector of positive integers, and returns a vector that sums to the target sum using only elements present in the provided vector of positive integers. Returns `-1` if `target sum` is unattainable.

## Surface Area

Design a function that takes in a 2-D array where each entry is the number of unit blocks (1 X 1) that are stacked on top of each other at each location and returns the surface area of the resultant 3-D object.
