# Problem_Solving

## Surface Area

Design a function that takes in a 2-D array where each entry is the number of unit blocks (1 X 1) that are stacked on top of each other at each location and returns the surface area of the resultant 3-D object.

## How Sum

Design a function that takes in a `target sum` and a vector of positive integers, and returns a vector that sums to the target sum using only elements present in the provided vector of positive integers. Returns `-1` if `target sum` is unattainable.
